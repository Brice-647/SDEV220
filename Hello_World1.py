    Doctstrings can be created using triple quotes or triple apostrophes.
    There are also single and double quotes for single-line docstrings.

    Immutable (cannot be changed after creation):
        int, float, complex
        bool
        str
        tuple
        frozenset
        bytes

    Mutable (can be changed after creation):
        list
        dict
        set
        bytearray

    Mutability matters because mutable objects can be modified in place,
    while immutable objects require creating a new value.
